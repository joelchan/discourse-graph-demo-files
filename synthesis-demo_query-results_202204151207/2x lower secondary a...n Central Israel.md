- Household contact studies are also important if testing is exhaustive and index cases are caregivers, since contact patterns with potential infectious individuals would be *higher* for children! And here we still frequently see lower [secondary attack rate.md](secondary attack rate.md)

    - This set is particularly important because the studies also include exhaustive testing of close contacts in addition to some ability to equate for exposure (same household).
