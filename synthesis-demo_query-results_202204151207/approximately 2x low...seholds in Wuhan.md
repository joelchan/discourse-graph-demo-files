- ## Summary::

    - Within the households of [assumed index cases](((Wbm3ygNjg))) in [Wuhan](((-_I0Xl_HM))), [children](((15wgvpaW8))) amongst [assumed secondary cases](((xRQZyg5e7))) were infected at lower rates ([~20% of tested cases compared to ~60-70% of tested cases for adults](((Z_-ed_kym))))

- ## Grounding Context:: ((how might we reproduce this observation?))

    - Setting ((where and when? any countermeasures in the setting?))

        - 85 patients from Wuhan in early pandemic [February 2020.md](February 2020.md)

        - Data collection ended on [February 28th, 2020.md](February 28th, 2020.md)

        - 155 secondary household contacts

        - 7% were children

    - Definition of index cases ((how did they identify the initial cases?)) Not defined - assumes the one in the hospital is index??

    - Definition of secondary contacts and cases ((how did they decide who to test for transmission from the index cases?)) Not defined - appears to be others in household that were not hospitalized??

    - Definition of children: not given

    - Testing regime ((sometimes studies will have multiple swabs, sometimes they will have antigen tests, etc.))

        - testingRegime:: Confirmed infection with PCR; Not exhaustive (104 out of 155 tested): not tested if asymptomatic for at least two weeks

- ## **Discussion**

    - “without results of serological studies, it is hard to tell if children are not susceptible”
