- # Summary

    - household secondary attack rate for children of index cases in Singapore was about 6 percent, and increased with age. specifically, ages 0-4 had 1.3% attack rate, followed by 8.1% for ages 5-9, and 9.8% for ages 10-16.

    - Attack rate was higher if the mother was the index case

- # Grounding Context

    - Setting: 137 households of 223 adult index patients in Singapore, roughly from March to April 2020

    - Case identification: looks like exhaustive testing of close contacts of confirmed cases

- Major result was that [household secondary ...creased with age.md](household secondary ...creased with age.md)

    - Can't really compare directly to adults (since adult contacts were not tested/analyzed in this study), but might get some rough sense by comparing household attack rates amongst adults in Singapore around the same time

    - Some recent results of household studies from China seem comparable: ~5% for < 20, compared to ~13-20 for 20 and up

                    - attack rate of 5% for under 20, then 13% for 20-59 and 17% for >= 60

                    - attack rate of 2.3% for children < 5yo, 5% for 6-17, and 20% in adults > 18

        - Would be good to compare with other household transmission studies

        - Also really want to know about household prevention mitigation steps

        - Note: this was early on the pandemic, so I think roughly ont he timeline, this was wild-type?
